<h1>What Is The Azure Service Fabric</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Where Is The Code?</h1>
<p>I have the code in my Github repo :

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>You will need to have the following components installed to run the code 
associated with this article</p>
<ul>
	<li>.NET 4.6.2 developer pack</li>
	<li>Azure Service Fabric 2.6 (or above) SDK</li>
	<li>Visual Studio 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What Is This Article Going To Show Me?</h1>
<p>This article will hopefully give you a taster of what is possible with the 
Azure Service Fabric, and will also show you how to perform common best 
practices such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dependency injection to facilitate better testing</li>
	<li>Introduce better logging system then relying on the one you get from a 
	new Azure Service Fabric template</li>
	<li>Talk about the fabric as a whole</li>
	<li>Show you how to protect sensitive information (such as connection 
	strings, its a public cloud after all)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We are using the Azure Service Fabric a fair bit, and it has not let us down 
so far. We mainly use it for siloed micro services that don't interact with each 
other that much, so we have not really needed to open any ports. However the 
scaling aspect of it, and the fact that this can be done via C#
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-concepts-scalability">
FabricClient</a> and
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-tutorial-scale-cluster">
PowerShell</a> on demand should we need to scal further is very sweet</p>
